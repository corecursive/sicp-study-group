; Indeed, as demonstrated in ex2-14.rkt, different algerbaically-equivalent expressions would lead
; to different computational results when the quantities.
; There appears to be a slight errata on page 97: the higher the tolerance's percentage of the center value of the resistance, the larger the differences in the results computed by par1 and par2 will come out.
; This is due to the fact that the quantities used in those (algerbaically-equivalent expressions) are not exact numbers that can be represnted by a machine (i.e. not integers), but in this case are intervals in the set of real numbers.
